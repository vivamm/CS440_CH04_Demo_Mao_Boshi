A software license is a legal instrument governing the use or redistribution of software.
Under United States copyright law all software is copyrightprotected, in source code as also object code form. 
The only exception is software in the public domain. 
I choose MIT license. Because it is a relaxed license. As long as the user includes a copyright statement and a license statement in the copy of the project, they can do whatever they want with your code, and you do not need to take any responsibility.
